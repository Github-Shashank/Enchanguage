# Enchanguage
I have created this code to easily convert enchanting table language to english .
Install python and open IDLE and press ctrl + o and save this file at this location.
You can use this by import enchanguage ( or with which you have saved your file name ) and then use these codes :-
enchanguage.code('hello') will result '⍑ᒷꖎꖎ𝙹'
enchanguage.decode('⍑ᒷꖎꖎ𝙹') will result 'hello'
